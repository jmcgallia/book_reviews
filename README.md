I review books here as I read them

## A History of the Modern Middle East
William E. Cleveland & Martin Bunton <br>
May '23 <br>
I've been reading this textbook sporadically over the past few months and am half-way through it. It starts with a great overview of ancient history and then goes into detail about the Ottoman Empire, Persia, the states created after the Ottomans, etc. (I'm at World War I as of writing this.) 

## Sapiens
Yuval Noah Harari <br>
April '23 <br>
An extremely interesting book that tries to give an outline of human history from as far back as we can go till now. I leared a lot about ancient homo-sapiens as well as other Sapien species that existed. I especially enjoyed reading theories about why we are the way we are (how language developed, the cognitive revolution, agricultural revolution, etc.) My only complaint is that later in the book I found explanations of some things that I actually know about to be extremely shallow and over-simplified, which made me doubt everything else that I read beforehand.

## Talking to Strangers
Malcolm Gladwell <br>
February '23 <br>

Basically a book about how humans evolved to be good at lying and bad at detecting it. My biggest take-away is that people can't really detect lies, and people you'd expect to be good at it like judges, detectives, or police are statistically just as bad or even worse than everyone else (due to over-confidence.) There were reasons that we evolved to be this way but I don't remember them as I write this.

## The Foundation Trilogy
Isaac Asimov <br>
2022 <br>
Some classic science-fiction with some very interesting ideas. I especially like how the book does world-building of a civilization over many years. The series is also a productt of its time. I found it amusing that 90% of dialog seemed to be between men smoking cigars in an office and that messages between spaceships were printed out and then run to the captain's office.
