## A History of the Modern Middle East - Part 3 -  From the Islamic Revival of the 70's till around 2016
William E. Cleveland & Martin Bunton <br>
August '23 <br>
I finally finished this textbook, and am quite satisfied with what I've learned from it. You can only fit so much into a textbook about an entire region of the world with thousand of years of history, but I feel like it did a pretty good job giving the best overview of events till now possible (in about 700 pages.) The final section I'm writing about covered the Islamic revival in the 70's, especially the 1979 revival in Iran, as well as a lot of information about the Gulf States and their formation, Iraq and Syria under Ba'athist regimes, the Lebanese Civil War, Intifadas in Israel and Palestine, the Gulf War, the US invasion of Iraq, the Iran-Iraq war, and more. It also talked extensively about the Palestine and Israel and the history of this conflict, as well as its effects around the middle-east. Finally, the book ends with some of the most recent happenings (in 2016 when it was published): The Iranian Nuclear deal, and the Arab Spring. 

## A History of the Modern Middle East - Part 2 - From the end of World War I to the Islamic Revival in the 70's
William E. Cleveland & Martin Bunton <br>

This section starts with how the British and French broke up the Ottoman Empire into many different 'mandates' following World War 1. The British promised Hussein bin Ali, king of the Hijaz, a big Arab state if he rebelled against the Ottomans during World War 1 in order to help the British. The rebellion was succesful and helped the British During WW1, but after the war most of the land promised to Hussein was divided between the British and French Mandates. The new kings of Jordan and Iraq were Husseins' sons. The monarchy in Jordan has lasted until modern times, but not the one in Iraq. The mandates were basically provinces where the British and French formed local governments, usually some kind of republic or constitutional monarchy. The British basically had the power to make these governments do anything they want and overrule any decisions made. These governments were in a constant flux of trying to appease the British and appear to be independent and anti-British at the same time. The mandates slowly gained independence in different ways. A variety of different things happened to these governments after independence. The founding of Israel and Israeli history was also covered, as well as wars between the Arab states and Israel. The founding of the Gulf States was covered. The history of the Turkish Republic during and after Ataturk's time, as well as Iran under Reza Shah, and Muhammad Reza Shah, were also incredibly interesting. I want to read more about the early Turkish Republic.

## A History of the Modern Middle East - Part 1 - From ancient history until the end of World War I
William E. Cleveland & Martin Bunton <br>
June '23 <br>
The book starts with an overview of ancient civilizations in the middle east and their accomplishments and general histories. Includes ancient Egypt, Persia, the Greek and Roman incursions into the middle east, and more. Next, it focuses a lot on the beginnings of Islam, since it is such an important factor in the middle east, and the history of the Islamic Caliphate and then the migration of Turkic people into the middle east. Finally, the Ottoman Empire and how it worked are discussed in depth (super interesting.) Interesting fact: During the early Ottoman Empire, the Sultan would send his children to be trained as administrators around the country. Upon the Sultan's death, the children would return to the capital and fight to the death. The remaining son would be the next Sultan. Ottoman civil and military practices are also extremely interesting. "The Eastern Question," concerning the relationship of Great Britain, Russia, and the Ottomans is also extremely interesting. 

## Sapiens
Yuval Noah Harari <br>
April '23 <br>
An extremely interesting book that tries to give an outline of human history from as far back as we can go till now. I leared a lot about ancient homo-sapiens as well as other Sapien species that existed. I especially enjoyed reading theories about why we are the way we are (how language developed, the cognitive revolution, agricultural revolution, etc.) My only complaint is that later in the book I found explanations of some things that I actually know about to be extremely shallow and over-simplified, which made me doubt everything else that I read beforehand.

## Talking to Strangers
Malcolm Gladwell <br>
February '23 <br>

Basically a book about how humans evolved to be good at lying and bad at detecting it. My biggest take-away is that people can't really detect lies, and people you'd expect to be good at it like judges, detectives, or police are statistically just as bad or even worse than everyone else (due to over-confidence.) There were reasons that we evolved to be this way but I don't remember them as I write this.

## The Foundation Trilogy
Isaac Asimov <br>
2022 <br>
Some classic science-fiction with some very interesting ideas. I especially like how the book does world-building of a civilization over many years. The series is also a productt of its time. I found it amusing that 90% of dialog seemed to be between men smoking cigars in an office and that messages between spaceships were printed out and then run to the captain's office.
